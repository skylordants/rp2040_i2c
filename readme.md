# Wrapper library for RP2040 I2C

This is a library I created for personal projects, for example [Pico_receiver](https://github.com/skylordants/Pico_receiver) to use in other libraries to make interfacing with I2C universal. I used it with [wizio-pico baremetal](https://github.com/Wiz-IO/wizio-pico) platform.

It is mostly based on code by ShawnHymel on [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.ee/en/maker/projects/raspberry-pi-pico-rp2040-i2c-example-with-micropython-and-cc/47d0c922b79342779cdbd4b37b7eb7e2), which seems unlicensed. I just made it OOP, saved the configuration and added some methods.
